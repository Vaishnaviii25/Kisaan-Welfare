# Kisaan-Welfare
Kisaan Welfare is developed by using a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict crop yield based on environmental and soil conditions. The model is trained using a dataset containing historical crop yield data along with corresponding environmental and soil data.

Crop yield prediction is an important task in agriculture as it helps farmers make informed decisions about crop management, resource allocation, and planning. This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict crop yield based on environmental and soil conditions. The model will be trained using a dataset containing historical crop yield data along with corresponding environmental and soil data.
